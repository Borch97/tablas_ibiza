UPDATE tts set tts_en = 'Ibiza seduces with its landscapes, its climate, its people and also because it offers the best gastronomy on the beach, in historic places, in the middle of the countryside or under a starry sky. Enjoy the luxury of eating natural products, at their exact point of ripeness, and remember the flavours of your childhood. Enjoy the peace and the atmosphere of freedom of the island, just when you are served a seafood rice dish by the sea or when you taste the freshest fish, with exquisite species such as grouper, tuna, John Dory or raor. Ibiza is a journey of sensations. The excellent quality of the raw ingredients is mixed with tradition in recipes that have come down to us with the same originality as always: sofrit pagès, matanzas rice, guisat de peix, greixonera or flaó are centuries-old dishes that transmit a culture and a way of life where the meeting of families and friends, respect for the legacy of the ancestors, the preservation of the natural environment and the

products of the land and also something as intangible as enjoying and being happy are essential. Let yourself be surprised by the local wine, virgin olive oil or local bread, delicacies that are on every table, accompanying magical moments in which eating means taking care of yourself, learning new things, sharing and smiling. WINE. Since the 8th century BC, the influence of the Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans has generated an important wine-growing tradition on the islands. The smallholding agrarian economy managed to maintain the cultivation of vines and the art of winemaking for personal consumption, a tradition passed down from father to son until the present day. In 1990 the wine trade was developed in the Pitiusas which, in a short period of time, has become one of the best wines of Mediterranean essence. These are very limited productions where quality prevails over quantity and from which wines with deep, provocative and balsamic aromas are obtained, with a smooth but structured body, ideal to accompany any dish of the local gastronomy. The native varieties are Monastrel and Garnacha in reds, while in whites the Malvasía variety stands out. Ibizan wines are made and produced in the areas of Sant Mateu, Buscastell, and Sant Josep. Vins de la Terra is the Geographical Indication that covers the entire production of Ibiza wine according to European regulations.' where index = 9;
