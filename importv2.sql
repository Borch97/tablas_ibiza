(9, 'Ibiza seduces with its landscapes, its climate, its people and also because it offers the best gastronomy on the beach, in historic places, in the mindexdle of the countrysindexe or under a starry sky. Enjoy the luxury of eating natural products, at their exact point of ripeness, and remember the flavours of your childhood. Enjoy the peace and the atmosphere of freedom of the island, just when you are served a seafood rice dish by the sea or when you taste the freshest fish, with exquisite species such as grouper, tuna, John Dory or raor. Ibiza is a journey of sensations. The excellent quality of the raw ingredients is mixed with tradition in recipes that have come down to us with the same originality as always: sofrit pagès, matanzas rice, guisat de peix, greixonera or flaó are centuries-old dishes that transmit a culture and a way of life where the meeting of families and friends, respect for the legacy of the ancestors, the preservation of the natural environment and the products of the land and also something as intangible as enjoying and being happy are essential. Let yourself be surprised by the local wine, virgin olive oil or local bread, delicacies that are on every table, accompanying magical moments in which eating means taking care of yourself, learning new things, sharing and smiling. WINE. Since the 8th century BC, the influence of the Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans has generated an important wine-growing tradition on the islands. The smallholding agrarian economy managed to maintain the cultivation of vines and the art of winemaking for personal consumption, a tradition passed down from father to son until the present day. In 1990 the wine trade was developed in the Pitiusas which, in a short period of time, has become one of the best wines of Mediterranean essence. These are very limited productions where quality prevails over quantity and from which wines with deep, provocative and balsamic aromas are obtained, with a smooth but structured body, indexeal to accompany any dish of the local gastronomy. The native varieties are Monastrel and Garnacha in reds, while in whites the Malvasía variety stands out. Ibizan wines are made and produced in the areas of Sant Mateu, Buscastell and Sant Josep. Vins de la Terra is the Geographical Indication that covers the entire production of Ibiza wine according to European regulations. OLIVE OIL. Olive oil has been produced on the island of Ibiza using traditional methods since ancient times. The existence of numerous oil mills (‘trulls’) and olive trees scattered among carob and almond trees testifies to the importance of this production, which was basically aimed at covering the needs of the local market. Nowadays there are two oil mills with modern installations that enable them to comply with current health legislation and obtain an excellent quality extra-virgin olive oil. The most common olive varieties in Ibiza are empeltre (traditional variety, also known as ibicencan), arbequina and picual. The first two give fruity oils which, with a little picual, increase their shelf life. The latter gives oils with a stronger taste. Oli d\'e is the collective guarantee brand created by the island\'s oil producers. IBICENCAN HERBS. Ibizan herbs are an aniseed-flavoured spirit obtained basically by extracting the aromas of various local plants such as rosemary, thyme, mint, peppermint, juniper, sage, fennel, lavender, lemon verbena and lemon and orange tree leaves. They are a very popular drink in Ibiza and are part of the tradition of many homes that have always made them by hand, each family following their own secret recipe on many occasions. Hierbas Ibicencas is the Geographical Indication that has protected this drink since 1997. FLAÓ. In the past, each typical Ibiza dish was eaten at a certain time of year, and in the case of flaó, this is associated with Easter (it was traditionally prepared for Easter Sunday). Nowadays it can be eaten at any time of the year. Flaó is a round cake made with eggs, fresh sheep\'s or sheep\'s and goat\'s cheese and mint leaves, which give it a very particular flavour reminiscent of Arabic, although its origins are mediaeval. Flaó d\'e is the Guarantee Mark that includes all the local producers who have registered. IBIZIAN LAMB. The meat of lamb born on Ibiza and reared on the island according to traditional practices (extensive free-grazing systems and vegetable feed) is certified by the Anyell d\'e Guarantee Mark. This meat is sold in authorised retail establishments and the product is clearly differentiated from other meats.

CERTIFIED HONEY FROM IBIZA. The honey produced on Ibiza is only harvested twice a year. In summer, multi-flower honey is harvested.');
